## @brief 
#
# Common steering constants and calculations.
#

# Constants: #
steer_speed_min = 3.8	            # minimum speed for calculation #
			            # (experimentally verified) #

# Determine steering angle (in degrees) for a given speed and yawrate.
#  
#   This computation is based on a simplified "bicycle model" of
#   vehicle steering geometery.  We ignore the slightly different
#   angles of the two front wheels, abstracting them into a single
#   wheel at the midline of the vehicle (like a bicycle or tricycle).
#  
#   Consider a radius from the center of the vehicle's turning circle
#   to the midpoint of the rear axle.  The vehicle's wheelbase is at
#   a right angle to this radius, since the rear wheels do not pivot.
#   The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the slightly longer
#   distance from the midpoint of the front axle back to the center
#   of the circle.  As long as the wheels do not slip, the acute
#   angle between the radius and the hypotenuse will be equal to the
#   angle of the front wheel relative to the midline of the vehicle.
#  
#   Thus, the tangent of the steering angle is the wheelbase (w)
#   divided by the radius (r).  We estimate r from the desired
#   yawspeed (y), assuming a constant velocity (v):
#  
#      y = (2*pi radians) / (2*pi*r/v seconds)
#      y = v/r radians/second
#      r = v/y
#
def steering_angle(v, y) :
    steer_radians = math.atan(ArtVehicle.wheelbase * y,v)
    steer_degrees = math.degrees(steer_radians)

    steer_degrees = min(steer_degrees, ArtVehicle.max_steer_degrees)
    steer_degrees = max(steer_degrees, -ArtVehicle.max_steer_degrees)

    return steer_degrees

# Determine yaw rate (in radians/second) for a given speed and
#  steering angle (in degrees).  Inverse of steering_angle().
#

def angle_to_yaw(v, angle) :
    return v * math.tan(math.radians(angle)) / ArtVehicle.wheelbase

maximum_yaw = angle_to_yaw(steer_speed_min, ArtVehicle.max_steer_degrees)
