[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/amogh/rosws2/src/art_map/CMakeLists.txt:49 (add_library):
  add_library cannot create target "artmap" because another target with the
  same name already exists.  The existing target is a shared library created
  in source directory "/home/amogh/rosws2/src/art_map".  See documentation
  for policy CMP0002 for more details.


[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/amogh/rosws2/src/art_map/CMakeLists.txt:50 (add_dependencies):
  Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target "art_map".

  The add_dependencies works for top-level logical targets created by the
  add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target commands.  If you want to
  add file-level dependencies see the DEPENDS option of the add_custom_target
  and add_custom_command commands.
